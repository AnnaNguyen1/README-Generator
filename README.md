This generator allows users to create a README file by answering prompts given in the terminal. Once all prompts are answered, users can copy the README file generated and add it to their project.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command(s):

```bash
npm i inquirer
```

## Usage Information

Run Node index.js in the terminal to run the prompts. After all questions are answered a README.md file will be generated.
